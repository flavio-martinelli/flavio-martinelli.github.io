It's Flavio here! I am currently a PhD student in the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcn/'>Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience</a> at <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/flavio.martinelli?lang=en'>EPFL</a>, supervised by <a href='https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/'>Wulfram Gerstner</a> and <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/johanni.brea/?lang=en'>Johanni Brea</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
