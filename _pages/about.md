I am a PhD student in the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcn/'>Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience</a> at <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/flavio.martinelli?lang=en'>EPFL</a>, supervised by <a href='https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/'>Wulfram Gerstner</a> and <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/johanni.brea/?lang=en'>Johanni Brea</a>. 

My main research revolves around understanding weight structures in neural networks. \
I apply this knowledge on the following topics: 

🕵️ ***Identifiability:*** can network parameters be reverse engineered? What types of constraints are needed? What are the implications for neural circuits?

🏋️ ***Trainability:*** what weight structures are easier or harder to learn? What are the weight structures of sub-optimal solutions (local minima)?

💡 ***Interpretability:*** understanding network symmetries to improve manipulation and interpretation of network models.
