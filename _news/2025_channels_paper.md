{% include labels/paper_label.html %} We found flat regions in loss landscapes arising from permutation symmetries! In our new paper we describe how they linked to saddle points and how they lead to a minimum at âˆž-norm that implements a Gated Linear Unit. We called them [Flat Channels to Infinity in Neural Loss Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14951).
