{% include labels/paper_label.html %} Our extension of [Expand-and-Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12794) for overparameterized networks have been accepted at the [NeurIPS UniReps workshop](https://unireps.org/2025/). We come up with ways to augment data specifically to extract informative signals from black-box networks. Check out [Data Augmentation Techniques to Reverse-Engineer Neural Network Weights from Input-Output Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972).
