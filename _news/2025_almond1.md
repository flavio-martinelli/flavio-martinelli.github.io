{% include labels/paper_label.html %} Our work on in-memory computing with memristive devices is out in Nature Machine Intelligence! We push the boundaries of what's computable in-memory, delegating both inference, error computation and error updates on the hardware side to minimize slow and inefficient cross-talk with a generic CPU. Have a look at [Actor–critic networks with analogue memristors mimicking reward-based learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01149-w)
