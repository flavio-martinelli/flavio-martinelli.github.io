  abstract={Recent advances in Voice Activity Detection (VAD) are driven by artificial and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), however, using a VAD system in battery-operated devices requires further power efficiency. This can be achieved by neuromorphic hardware, which enables Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to perform inference at very low energy consumption. Spiking networks are characterized by their ability to process information efficiently, in a sparse cascade of binary events in time called spikes. However, a big performance gap separates artificial from spiking networks, mostly due to a lack of powerful SNN training algorithms. To overcome this problem we exploit an SNN model that can be recast into a recurrent network and trained with known deep learning techniques. We describe a training procedure that achieves low spiking activity and apply pruning algorithms to remove up to 85% of the network connections with no performance loss. The model competes with state-of-the-art performance at a fraction of the power consumption comparing to other methods.}

  abstract={Advances of deep learning for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have led to significant improvements in the performance of digital signal processing systems implemented on digital chips. Although recent progress in low-power chips is remarkable, neuromorphic chips that run Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based applications offer an even lower power consumption, as a consequence of the ensuing sparse spikebased coding scheme. In this work, we develop a SNN-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system that belongs to the building blocks of any audio and speech processing system. We propose to use the bin encoding, a novel method to convert log mel filterbank bins of single-time frames into spike patterns. We integrate the proposed scheme in a bilayer spiking architecture which was evaluated on the QUT-NOISE-TIMIT corpus. Our approach shows that SNNs enable an ultra low-0power implementation of a VAD classifier that consumes only 3.8 Î¼W, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.}
